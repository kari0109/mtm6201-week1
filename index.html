                <p>
                    My name is <strong class="hiruth">Hiruth S Kariyawasam</strong>, and I come from Sri Lanka. I am
                    the
                    1<sup>st</sup> born in my family of 5, so I have 2 younger sisters who look up to me. I am
                    currently
                    studying in Canada hoping to open up a pathway to chase my dreams and this is still the
                    beginning of my
                    journey.
                </p>

                    Whether it is a lie concocted to deceive a person for nefarious reasons or white lie excuse for
                    why you
                    are late for class or multi-billion-dollar movie or just a person standing in the middle of the
                    road,
                    everything has an intrigue beckoning our curiosity to come to look and devour and that very
                    essence is
                    what I call a <em>story</em>. Since I was a kid, I was always ready to hear a good story and now
                    I chase
                    after stories always looking for the next best thing, whether it is reading, watching, or
                    hearing, I always find something to satiate this hunger of my curiosity. As currently as I am of
                    now, an <abbr title="Animation">anime</abbr> adorer, a manga enjoyer and a game fanatic, I aspire to
                    become either a storyboard artist or a concept artist in the future and I do hope to share stories
                    with one and all.
